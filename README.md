# Parking-Lot-System
Parking lot system which keeps the occupied lots in mind 
This Verilog-based project implements an Automated Parking System using a Finite State Machine (FSM). The system sequentially checks parking spots and guides vehicles to an available space. It transitions between states—initial, path, parking, and final—based on the availability of spots and vehicle actions. The FSM uses D Flip-Flops for state storage, ensuring reliable transitions, and outputs a signal when parking is successfully completed. The system resets to its initial state once a vehicle vacates the spot, ready to process the next vehicle. This design demonstrates efficient state management and practical sequential circuit implementation.
